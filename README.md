## 📖 Project Description

This project demonstrates how to write, deploy, and interact with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.  
It includes essential components like variable declarations, functions, and event handling — giving you a hands-on introduction to Solidity programming.

The contract is designed to be simple enough for beginners but structured in a way that can easily be extended for more complex decentralized applications (dApps).

## ⚙️ What It Does

This smart contract allows users to interact with blockchain logic directly.  
It might include functionalities like:

- Storing and retrieving data  
- Managing balances or ownership  
- Executing secure transactions  
- Emitting events on state changes  

Below is the Solidity code used in this project:

```solidity
//paste your code
